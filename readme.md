## Introduction

The Lorenz Attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to a system of differential equations. This project uses SFML to visualize the attractor by simulating the movement of particles in a 2D space.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- SFML: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)

## Installation

1. **Install SFML:**

   Follow the instructions on the [SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) to download and install SFML on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lorentz-attractor-sfml.git

Build the Project:

Navigate to the project directory and build the executable:

bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++11 -o main main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
Usage
Run the executable to start the simulation:

bash
Copy code
./main
The application window will appear, displaying the trajectories of multiple particles moving according to the Lorenz Attractor equations.

Customization
Feel free to customize the simulation by adjusting parameters such as the number of particles, initial positions, and simulation constants in the code.
